# datavis
repository for the final project for the datavis course at UCU

### Description:
This project analyses plane crash data for 1959-2009 (in the dataset it starts from 1908). The original dataset was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908). For the moment the analysis is only for non-military plane crashes, but might be expanded later. 

The code can be found on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DK2aYVMPiZbixKU1oJrMS8HrvNFwtUZg).


### TO DO:
- [x] parsed the data & got rid of trash
- [x] created several visualisation, including a couple of them interactive
- [ ] add more creative visualisations, maybe analyse military plane crashes as well?
- [ ] fix minor bugs (such as Y axis slightly changing in one of the visualisations)
