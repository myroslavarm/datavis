# datavis
repository for the final project for the datavis course at UCU


### Description:
This project analyses plane crash data for 1959-2009 (in the dataset it starts from 1908). The original dataset was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908). For the moment the analysis is only for non-military plane crashes, but might be expanded later. 

The code can be found on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DK2aYVMPiZbixKU1oJrMS8HrvNFwtUZg).


### To do:
- [x] parsed the data & got rid of trash
- [x] created several visualisation, including a couple of them interactive
- [x] add more creative visualisations
- [x] fix minor bugs (such as Y axis slightly changing in one of the visualisations)


### Conclusion:
It seems that even though there are less plane crashes than used to be before (see visualisations in previous sections), that hasn't exactly changed the situation when the plane crashes do happen -- over the years they haven't become less deadly. Sure, over the years you can spot than in some instances more people survived than in others, but as a whole 50 years of commercial flight & aviation history haven't seemed to change the fact that when the plane crashes, usully, if not all, most people still die.

This research project visually demonstrates that even though the practices over the years have gotten better and the amount of plane crashes has decreased, humanity has yet to figure out how to avoid plane crashes being deadly when they do happen.
